# social-touch-semi-controlled

social touch experiments with manually delivered human touch

Isabella's project at LiU

# microneurography experiments

enter participant code, unit name/number, number of repeats

stimulus sequence control

trigger kinect recording

visual and/or audio cue with the name of the upcoming stimulus

trigger/sync signal -> TTL to nerve recording and LED to camera (make sure it is visible)

metronome for timing during stimulus delivery

trigger/sync signal off

Kinect off

log files

can cancel at any time, saves data so far (data saved after every stimulus)

filename: semi-controlled_date_time_participant_unit

(consider including multiple stimuli per kinect recording - trade-off between faster experiment and easier tracking vs. failures affect fewer stimulus presentations)

# psychophysics experiments

as above, but add:

randomise stimulus sequence

get participant response

no need to sync with nerve recording (no TTL), but LED still needed to sync with camera
